\section{The absolut basics}

\subsection{Background}

\subsection{Enter Python}

Python code is executed by the python enterpreter. 
\begin{verbatim}
python app1.py
\end{verbatim}
This tells the python enterpreter program to run the code in app1.py.
A different way to let the code "run itself" is by using the following as first line
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
...code...
\end{verbatim}
Then make the script runnable with the chmod command
\begin{verbatim}
chmod +x app1.py
\end{verbatim}
Now you can run the script as an application. \it{./app1.py}.

\subsection{First program}

Lets write a simple python program that prints "Hello World".
Use an editor (as per instruction) to create a file in  a work directory and put the following content into it. 
Not that that whitespaces are important in python.

Create the file app1.py and pu the following content into it.
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World")

\end{verbatim}
Run program the program with \it{python app1.py}.

Several things are going on here
